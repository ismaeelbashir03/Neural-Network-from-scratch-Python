# Neural-Network-from-scratch-Python
This is a Neural Network I made from scratch in python using only numpy and pythons standard libraries thanks to the help of the nnfs book which helped me understand all the mathematical concepts. This file can be imported and its classes and functions have been designed to be used similarly to other neural network libraries. I have also included a worked example of the file in use
